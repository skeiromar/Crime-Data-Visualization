# Crime Data visualization


### Background

Crime data visualization is a visualization website that shows the crime data in NYC from 2006 to 2017. It is useful for 
understanding crime trends in New York city via toggling of different factors. 


### Features  

Users will be able to:
- [ ] visualize the crime data using a heat map
- [ ] Identify areas with dense crime activity
- [ ] Filter by types of crimes
- [ ] See how crime data changed over the years

### Getting Started

The app will consist of controls on the left side and a map on the right. The map will reflect the controls on the left side.
By default you will be taken to a map of NYC with crime data as heat map signatures throughout NYC.



### Technologies

This project is implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for logic
- `HTML5` for rendering the page
- `Google Maps API` and `Google Heatmap` for rendering the map and its elements


### Implementation Timeline 

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including webpack. Set the default files and get the map to render on the page and one 
coordinate with a marker.

**Day 2**: Spend the day learning how to integrate JSON API with Google Maps and how to fine tune the data displayed on the map.

**Day 3**: Get the Map to show with heat map signatures, a UI on the left side and other details.

**Day 4**: Get the ui to work harmoniusly with the map to update information according to the parameters within the UI.
